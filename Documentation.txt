The main file of this project is index.html, where you can find the frame of the page and the elements that compose it.

In the folder "public/CSS", you can find the styles of the project, in the file "main.css". Some of those styles, define the behavior of the Navigation, in mobile and desktop versions.

"fonts.css", contains the rules to use the requested fonts, and one aditional font-family that I use in the footer of the desktop versions. Those fonts are saved in the folder "public/fonts".

As a requirement, the items of the Navigation menu are loaded from a JSON file, hosted in data/nav.json. 
In the folder "public/js", is the file "navjson.js" that makes the magic: it extract the info of the JSON file, converts it in a javascript object, and shows that info in the index.html. In "navjson.js", you can find the explained process in more specific words.

The "index.js" makes the front-end core interactions, about the mobile hamburger menu (openNav function), and complementary behaviors of the mobile and desktop navigation. There, you can find a more technical description of the developed process.

The development process was realized using git and github. 
In this link you can find the performed process in small milestones:
